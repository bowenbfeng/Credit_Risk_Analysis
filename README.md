# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

> Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, youâ€™ll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes.

In this project, imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries have been used to build models and evaluate them using a resampling method. The data is first oversampled by using randomoversampler and SMOTE algorithms and undersampled with the clustercentroid algorithm. Then, a combination approach is applied to oversample and undersample by using SMOTEENN. At last, the two machine learning models are compared and evaluated by using minimize bias, Balanced Random Forest Classifier and Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier.
